           <p> Nearly 35 percent of people don’t read books at all. More than 60 percent of us read no more than one or two books a year. This statistic astonishes me. It reflects the reality that humanity is still pretty far away from living in the world led by wisdom.</p>

            <p>Why is it so important to read books?
            So, here we have two questions I will try to answer.
            Why do most of the people don’t do that?</p>

<p>There are several ways of greatly enriching yourself:
journeys,
new relationships,
and books…
Of course, you should use them all, but reading books, as you see, is the easiest way. It seems to be obvious, but, as statistics show, most people don’t do that.</p>

<p>There are many reasons to read books a lot, here are only some of them.</p>

<p>Firstly, <strong>books provide you with innumerable number of ideas.</strong> Ideas that could change your life, that could make it better if only you use them properly. After finding many new ideas in books, you will start coming up with your own . You know, ideas today rule the world, so it’s a great reason to read more.</p>

<p>On the other hand,<strong> while reading, your brain is working really hard.</strong> It has to convert symbols to words and words to sentences. Then, it HAS to understand the basic meaning of the sentence. And after that, if you are a good reader, your brain will find out the deeper sense of what you’ve just read. And this process is going on amazingly fast while you are reading. Scientific research says that when you read, your brain activity looks like a New Year's Tree with blinking garlands! It means that nearly all parts of your brain work while you are reading. Why not to start today?</p>

<p>Interestingly , that <strong>more than 86 percent of rich people love to read</strong>, while only 30 percent of the poor ones read more than several books a year. I’m inspired by this fact and I believe it should inspire you.</p>

<p>Finally, <strong>reading a good book is an enjoyable process.</strong> I believe you would love it.</p>

<p>Second question is much harder to answer. Reasons for not reading could be very different.</p>

<p>Some people are simply a little bit lazy - they should just push themselves to do it. Others still don’t believe reading is extremely important - I hope this short article will help them. Somebody says they have no money for books. It also isn’t a truth because if you read this it means you have a computer or a smartphone, so you can find many useful books on the internet.</p>

<p>By the way, you can buy a special e-book reader with the technology of e-ink which makes the screen of the e-book similar to paper and absolutely harmless for your eyes. E-books with e-ink screen are not too expensive, their price is comparable with the price of 10 to 30 books: it’s fewer than any intelligent person reads per year. After you buy this device, you can find thousands of free books on the net and read them whenever and wherever you want.</p>

<p>Another popular excuse for not reading is a lack of time. Frankly speaking, it’s bullshit. You can always find enough time for everything you really want. As Jackson Brown said, “Don't say you don't have enough time. You have exactly the same number of hours per day that were given to Helen Keller, Pasteur, Michaelangelo, Mother Teresa, Leonardo da Vinci, Thomas Jefferson, and Albert Einstein.”</p>

<p>Of course, you can find more excuses for not reading every single day, but maybe it would be better just to do it?</p>

<p>P.S. Perhaps you want to ask me, if I’m following my own advice. Ok, here is <a href="https://vk.com/note152038521_11799757" target="_blank">the list of the books I’ve read since 2013.</a>
Unfortunately, I didn’t record the books I’d read before the mentioned year.
    Hope it doesn’t look like an attempt to boast. Good luck.</p>
